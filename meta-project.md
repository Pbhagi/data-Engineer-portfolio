## Real-Time Recommendation Data Pipelines (META)
## Overview

Engineered large-scale data pipelines powering recommendation systems and experimentation platforms processing billions of user events daily.

## Impact
-Processed billions of events/day,
-Built low-latency feature pipelines,
-Enabled large-scale A/B testing analytics,

## Key Contributions
-Built high-throughput batch & streaming pipelines using Spark (EMR) and Kafka to process billions of daily user interactions
-Designed feature engineering pipelines generating model-ready datasets for recommendation systems
-Developed low-latency data pipelines supporting near real-time inference and ranking systems

## Engineered advanced features:
-time-decayed engagement metrics
-content recency scoring
-regional user behavior aggregation
-Optimized Delta Lake storage & S3 partitioning for efficient joins on petabyte-scale datasets
-Built reusable ETL frameworks with schema validation, backfills, and data quality checks
-Developed A/B testing pipelines computing metrics like CTR, retention, and engagement
-Stored experiment results in Redshift, enabling large-scale experiment analysis
